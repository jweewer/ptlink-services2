HOW-TO
import databases from other services

*****
NOTE: Only nick/pass/email and chan/founder/pass/access info will be imported.
*****

1) Check if there is an .stbd output .diff for your services on 
    the /import directory. If you don't find a patch for them
    please email to Coders@PTlink.net requesting for it with the
    URL for those services source, if we have the time, the patch
    will be on next PTlink Services version.

2) Untar your prior services source code and apply the patch with:
	patch -p1 < servicesversion.diff
	(You must be on your services source root dir.)

3) Install the patched version and run ./listchans -c, 
    during channel list count the files nick.stdb and chan.stdb 
    will be created on your data directory, those files 
    will be used with import-stdb.

4) "make import-stdb" from PTlink.Services source root dir.

5) copy src/import-stdb binary, nick.stdb and chan.stdb files and 
    PTlink Services services.conf to the same directory,
    run ./import-stdb.
    You will now have the new *.db ready to use with PTlink Services
