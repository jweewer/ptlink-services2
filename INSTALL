PTlink Services 2 INSTALL
--------------------------

NOTE: For security sake you should run PTlink Services with root,
please create a normal user to install it.

0.  Read the CHANGES file to find out about the new features 
in this version.

1.  Run the configure script.  It will create include/setup.h and the
Makefiles to match your system:
	./configure
As default services will be installed to $HOME/services to specify a different
  install directory use ./configure --prefix=path/to/install/dir

2.  Edit the the "include/config.h" file for advanced options customization.  

3.  "make" should build services.

4.  "make install" to install the services and tools in the path defined
in config.h.
NOTE: services install will kill the running services if services .pid is found
	  and launch the new one with the existing .conf files.

5.
  Copy example.conf to services.conf on ~/services/etc dir
  Edit services.conf and copy ./src/lang/*.auth,*.setmail 
  to ~/services/data/languages if you pretend to use the email 
  authentication option.
